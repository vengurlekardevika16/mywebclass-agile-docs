## TASK 2

**Task Title:** Implement Agile and Lean principles in website development process.

**User Story:** As a development team member, I want to adopt Agile Manifesto and Lean Principles in our website development process so that we can deliver high-quality software efficiently and continuously.

**Description:**
* Define and prioritize product backlog items collaboratively with the product owner, following Agile principles and practices. 
* Plan and work in short, time-boxed iterations, delivering potentially shippable increments of the product at the end of each iteration.

* Apply Lean principles, such as minimizing waste, optimizing flow, and empowering the team, to eliminate bottlenecks and improve efficiency. Embrace a test-driven development (TDD) approach, writing tests first and then writing the code to pass the tests, to ensure software quality and maintainability. 
* Adopt continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) practices, automating testing, building, and deployment processes to deliver software frequently and reliably. 
* Encourage a culture of continuous learning and improvement, providing opportunities for training, mentoring, and knowledge sharing.
